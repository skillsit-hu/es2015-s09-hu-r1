# Introduction
You used to work as a freelance software developer, but now you've applied for a job as a developer at a large software development company. The company's management wants to test your skills, so as part of the recruitment process, they asked you to develop a prototype web application for a Freight Container company. In addition to sharing up-to-date information about the yard containing the containers, it also helps operators import incoming containers and list already placed containers.

Yards are divided into blocks, each block has multiple bays, in them there are stacks and tiers.

In the prototype, all you need to develop is a dashboard and a searchable list of containers. The dashboard depicts a yard with containers, so operators can easily see the available capacity of each block, stack.. The list contains the containers and allows the operators to easily search information in them.

Each container has a Block, bay, stack and tier number. In each position one and only one container can be placed. The yard has 4 blocks and each block has 5 bays, 5 stacks and 5 tiers.

Your API must use a [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as its data provider.

# Description of project and tasks

Your task is divided into three parts.

1. In the first part, you will develop the REST API for UIs and import functions.

2. In the second part, you have to create a web based dashboard.

3. In the third part, you will develop a searchable list for containers.

# How to submit your work

1. To submit your assignment, you will need to share a GitHub repository (hereafter referred to as repo) containing the source code of your solution. YY is the two-digit personal code that we have emailed to you. If you have not used GitHub before, you can register an account at https://github.com and then create a private repo as es2025-s09-r1-YYY, where YYY is the three-digit serial number we have emailed you. You then need to share the repo containing your solution with us. To do this, use our GitHub id `skillsithu`.
2. Share a link with us in email (es2025s09@skillsit.hu) from where we can download the executable files and code to test your solutions.
3. Your README file has to contain the instructions how to start your project backend and frontend. We prefer to give executable files or a built solution.
