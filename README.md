# Introduction
You used to work as a freelance software developer, but now you've applied for a job as a developer at a large software development company. The company's management wants to test your skills, so as part of the recruitment process, they asked you to develop a prototype web application for a Freight Container company. In addition to sharing up-to-date information about the yard containing the containers, it also helps operators import incoming containers and list already placed containers.

Yards are divided into blocks, each block has multiple bays, in them there are stacks and tiers.

In the prototype, all you need to develop is a dashboard and a searchable list of containers. The dashboard depicts a yard with containers, so operators can easily see the available capacity of each block, stack.. The list contains the containers and allows the operators to easily search information in them.

Each container has a Block, bay, stack and tier number. In each position one and only one container can be placed. The yard has 4 blocks and each block has 5 bays, 5 stacks and 5 tiers.

Your API must use a [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as its data provider.
